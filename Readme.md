# Vue Seed Project

This should be a very easy jumping-off point for code that uses vue, and typescript. This is a very basic project, and 
is not designed to have a real server piece, or even default reactivity beyond what Vue has.

## Usage

To get a copy of this project, simply run:

```bash
$ npx degit gitlab:morgul/vue-seed my-proj -m=git
```
